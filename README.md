# Talking Robot

This is the repository for the LSO (Operating Systems Lab.) project.

## Features

This client-server architecture will enable you to interact with Furhat, a humanoid social robot.
The interaction style will be based on the TIPI questionnaire to establish personality type.
The dialogue management will be done through OpenAI in the client, which will be developed in Python in order to use Realtime APIs.
